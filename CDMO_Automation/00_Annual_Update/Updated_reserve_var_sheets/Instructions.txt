Copy all the new Reserve_Level_Plotting_Template files (from separate zip archive) to this 
subdirectory.  They should be named "Reserve_Level_Plotting_Template_xxx_YYYY.xlsx", 
where xxx is the reserve abbreviation (in lower case) and YYYY is the year.  
This naming convention will make it easier for reserves to identify their different analyses.
